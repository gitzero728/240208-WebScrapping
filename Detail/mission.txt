I have a Word file that contain table with 600~700 rows and 2 columns.
The 1st column contains a name of product, 2nd column contains an price of product.
The maximum lenght of name is around 50 letters. There are also '.' and '-' in the names and also some letters. There is no space in the product names.

The algorithm must be able to open the website https://www.jomashop.com/, enter the name of product in 1st column into the search bar of Jomashop.
Then open the product and see if the price of product from 2st column matches any number on the product page of the opened product.
If no product is found when entering the name of product in 1st column, there should be a message at the end that this product was not found and even if the amount of money cannot be found, it should be reported.
If there are more than one products after opening the search bar it is should also be reported.
